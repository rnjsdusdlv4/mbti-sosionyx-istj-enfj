<p align="center"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><font face="gabriola" color="black">It is a constantly evolving conflict, the worst of all other relationships. But at first I do not notice it. Rather, it is more attractive and interesting. I am confident that both of us can live well and cooperate peacefully, but as soon as we realize the idea of &nbsp;not being here, the problem of this relationship arises. I mistakenly think that if the cause of the problem is trivial and easy to correct, and if I try to understand a little more about my opponent, I will easily solve it. Unfortunately, efforts to advance the relationship cause conflicts between them, and at the beginning of the conflict, they give the most serious injuries to each other as arguments. The injured opponent is more aggressive and repelling. At each conflict, the relationship gets worse and worse. Despite showing confidence that the opponent is not convinced, he has no ability to protect his weak side. This leads to discrepancies and disappointments. After a few unprofitable attempts to make the relationship stable, they feel relinquished, broken, and finally liberated.</font></span></p>
